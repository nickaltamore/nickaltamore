I am a Physics graduate with a passion for data and especially  data analysis and visualisation. I am about to graduate from a 12-week intensive Digital Skills Bootcamp in Data with JustIT training. I am looking to build on my skills and develop new skills to develop a career as a data analyst. I have completed several data projects using Excel, SQL, Python, R, Tableau and PowerBI which you can find in my PortfolioProjects repository.

I would like to establish myself as a Junior Data Analysis role and develop my skills in a team of dedicated data professionals.. I am looking to use my data skills and problem-solving abilities to meet new challenges head on and contribute to making important data-driven decisions.
